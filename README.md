# Archicteture to build and optimize image dataset's

## Concept
This architecture was built in order to facilitate the exploration of any kind of dataset related to image processing. It was built using the best practices of oriented object pattern, such as: object factories, strategy, template, among others. 
It allows the user, the reading/extraction of data and its treatment.
It also allows the user, to create models and optimize them.
Some of the models already established by default are: AlexNet and VGGNet networks.
In addition, training strategies are already established, which may or may not be used, such as: Undersampling, Oversampling and Data Augmentation.
Finally, it is also provided the possibility for the user to optimize his models, using optimization algorithms such as Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), or Genetic Algorithm (GA).
